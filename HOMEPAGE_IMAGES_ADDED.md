- WebP format support from Unsplash CDN

### Responsive Behavior

### Accessibility
- All images have descriptive `alt` text
- Proper ARIA labels maintained
- Images enhance but don't replace content

## Visual Impact

- Less visual interest
- More abstract presentation

### After

- Creates emotional connection
- Looks more professional and trustworthy
- Better represents real people and scenarios

## Performance Considerations
- Images are loaded from Unsplash CDN (fast, reliable)

- Quality parameter set to 80 for good balance

## Browser Compatibility
